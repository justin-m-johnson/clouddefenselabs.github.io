# Enhancing Cybersecurity with AI: Introducing my AI-Powered Security Tools

In today’s digital landscape, cybersecurity is more critical than ever. With the increasing complexity of cyber threats, leveraging advanced technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) can significantly enhance our ability to detect and mitigate vulnerabilities. In this blog post, I am excited to introduce my new repository, [AI Tools for Cybersecurity](https://github.com/justinmjohnson/ai_tools), which contains a collection of Python-based security tools that utilize OpenAI’s ChatGPT to provide detailed security recommendations. In the future I will incorporate it with local AI (ollama) so that it can be used "in house" and won't (potentially) expose potentially unwanted information to the public.

The primary goal of this repository is to continously update and create a suite of tools that can automate various cybersecurity tasks and provide insightful recommendations using AI. By integrating OpenAI’s ChatGPT, I aim to offer a more intelligent and comprehensive approach to security analysis, making it easier for security professionals to identify and address potential threats.

By integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT into my security tools, I aim to provide a more intelligent and comprehensive approach to security analysis. This will enable security professionals to

- Automate routine tasks and focus on higher-value activities

- Gain deeper insights into potential threats and vulnerabilities

- Make data-driven decisions with confidence

# What’s Inside the Repository?
This repository is organized into multiple folders, each containing a specific security tool. So far I only have one tool as of this writing, but I plan to add more tools in the future.

1. Nmap AI Security Scanner
Description: This tool scans a local subnet for open ports using nmap and sends the results to OpenAI’s ChatGPT for security recommendations. The results and recommendations are saved to a text file for easy reference.
Features:
Scans all ports on a specified subnet.
Provides detailed security recommendations based on the scan results.
Saves the output to a text file for further analysis.
Usage: Detailed instructions can be found in the nmap_ai folder.


# Identifying the Need: 

I started by identifying common cybersecurity tasks that could benefit from automation and AI-driven insights. Common tasks like network scanning, vulnerability assessment, and log analysis can all be completed and automated using Python (and other FOSS/paid tools) already. However, once you have the results, you need to know how to interpret them.


As a fresh cybersecurity analyst or someone new to the field, understanding how to read and interpret the results of these tasks can be overwhelming. That's where AI comes in. It can help you by providing insights that you would otherwise have to manually find out yourself. Having an AI assistant who can help you understand your results and provide advice on possible next steps is invaluable.


# The Road Ahead:


In the future, I plan to incorporate local AI (ollama) so that this repository can be used "in house" and won't potentially expose sensitive information to the public. I also aim to continuously update and create a suite of tools that can automate various cybersecurity tasks and provide insightful recommendations using AI.
